        <ul>1:Confidentiality: "Confidentiality" is the fundamental aim of network security. The function of "Confidentiality" is to secure valuable corporate data (in storage or in transit) from unauthorized individuals. The confidentiality component of Network Security ensures that data is only accessible to those who are intended and authorized. Access to company data should be restricted to those who are authorized to access it.</ul>
        <ul>2:Integrity: "Integrity" is the second purpose of network security. The goal of integrity is to maintain and ensure the correctness and consistency of data. The objective of Integrity is to ensure that the date is correct and dependable, and that it has not been altered by unauthorized individuals or hackers. The data received by the receiver must be exactly the same as the data supplied by the sender, with not a single bit of data changed.</ul>
        <ul>3:Availability: "Availability" is the third purpose of network security. The role of "Availability" in Network Security is to ensure that Data, Network Resources, or Network Services are always available to legitimate users whenever they need them.</ul>
        <ul>4:Follow a software development process to analyze a problem, and to design, build and test software solutions.</ul>
        <ul>5:Demonstrate software development skills using more than one programming language and development environment.</ul>
        <ul>6:Design and implement software solutions for mobile devices or embedded systems on multiple platforms.</ul>
